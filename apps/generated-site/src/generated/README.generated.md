## Data And Integration Notes

- The public storefront brand is Vogue Elegance.
- Product names, prices, compare-at prices, sale labels, sold-out labels, and photos were checked from public Magnolia Bags new-arrivals pages on June 25, 2026.
- Product photos are stored locally in `src/generated/assets` so runtime rendering stays self-contained.
- Cart, checkout, payment method selection, GST, and invoice calculations run locally in React state.
- The payment popup is a checkout preview and does not collect card, UPI, wallet, or banking credentials.
- The Google Maps action uses a direct map link. The visible map is a local themed illustration, not an embedded tracking iframe.
- The Google-style login is a local demo control and does not load OAuth scripts, store passwords, use secrets, or make backend calls.

## Admin Visibility

The admin inventory lists render only after signing in through the local Google-style button with:

- `jhilam.astro@gmail.com`

The entered Gmail address is stored as `localStorage.vogueEleganceUserEmail` for this generated demo.
