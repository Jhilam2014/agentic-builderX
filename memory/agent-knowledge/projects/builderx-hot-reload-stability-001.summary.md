# Project Execution Summary

Fixed generated-site preview instability during Generate. The root cause was a hard generated-site container restart occurring while the iframe Vite client was hot-reloading changed modules, which caused `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE`, `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET`, and WebSocket failures. The generator also wrote `generatedPage.jsx` before support data in the operation order, which could briefly expose missing imports during HMR.

The backend now uses Vite hot reload by default and only restarts the generated-site container when `RESTART_GENERATED_CONTAINER=true`. Generated file operations are applied in dependency-safe order.
