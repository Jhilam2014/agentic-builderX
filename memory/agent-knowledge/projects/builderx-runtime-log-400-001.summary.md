# Project Execution Summary

Updated Agentic BuilderX so MCP runtime status remains visible after the Generate button is clicked. The backend now keeps and serves the latest 400 runtime log rows, newest first. The frontend now merges server-sent events with periodic `/api/runtime-log` polling, deduplicates rows, sorts by timestamp descending, and caps the display at 400 rows.

No secrets or raw private data are included in this summary.
