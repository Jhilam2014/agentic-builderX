# BuilderX MCP Runtime Log Summary

Added MCP runtime status logging for generation requests. The backend now emits and persists request, orchestration, generation, file-write, restart, and completion events. The frontend shows a dedicated `MCP runtime log` panel and reconnects to the event stream automatically.
