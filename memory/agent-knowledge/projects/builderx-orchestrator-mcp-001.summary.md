# BuilderX Orchestrator MCP Handoff Summary

Builder app instructions now pass through `orchestratorAgent.js`, which normalizes raw prompt text into a structured build request containing objective, page type, topic, audience, tone, sections, constraints, and MCP handoff metadata. MCP generation uses the orchestrated instruction string instead of raw user text.
