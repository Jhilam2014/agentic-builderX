# Agent Knowledge Record

## Objective

Own the containerized Agentic BuilderX fullstack webpage generation system.

## Current Instruction Summary

Maintain a professional React control surface, Express backend, MCP-compatible generation endpoint, isolated generated-site runtime, deterministic constrained path selection, standalone Docker packaging for every newly created project, and what-next path knowledge for project decisions.

## Skills

React, Node.js, Express, Docker Compose, Vite, and MCP-style JSON-RPC.

## Tools

Filesystem edits, local validation, and Docker Compose configuration checks.

## Project History Summary

Created during the initial Agentic BuilderX large build.

## Deliverable Patterns

Produces fullstack monorepo scaffolds with frontend/backend/runtime container separation, project-local standalone Docker assets including `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`, Docker run instructions, deterministic path-scoring records, relevant feature expansion, and what-next path records for future development decisions.

## Validation Results

Initial validation is recorded under `observability/validation/latest-validation.json`.

## User Correction Patterns

No correction history yet.

## Capability Score Summary

Initial conservative score: capability 60, accuracy 50, reliability 50, adaptability 70, reuse confidence 40.

## Lessons Learned

Use an isolated generated-site container with shared source volume and Vite hot reload for safe live previews.
Generated projects must also be able to run outside BuilderX through their own Docker Compose stack without relying on BuilderX-only services or shared playground volumes.
When path confidence is low or multiple routes are plausible, ask the Human Agent to choose before continuing and store that decision as reusable what-next knowledge.
The agent should turn initial instructions into the closest achievable end application by adding only relevant features that improve usefulness, completeness, reliability, deployability, and maintainability while preserving constraints.
Self-sustainability means the agent increasingly knows the next best step from stored evidence, not that it bypasses human review, validation, safety, or user intent.

## Upgrade History

No upgrades yet.

## Reuse Guidance

Reuse for BuilderX fullstack changes involving prompt generation, MCP routing, preview runtime, or container orchestration.
