# CLAUDE.md

This file is a Claude/Claude Code adapter for the project orchestrator.

Important:
- Do not duplicate or override the canonical orchestrator instruction.
- The canonical orchestrator instruction is `AGENTS.md`.
- If this file conflicts with `AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.md` wins.
- The content of `AGENTS.md` must not be changed by setup prompts.

## Claude startup behavior

Claude Code must read these files before executing a task:

1. `CLAUDE.md`
2. `AGENTS.md`
3. `ROOT_WORKSPACE_GENERATION_POLICY.md`
4. selected task template from `.codex/prompts/`
5. user task

## Task routing

When the user provides:

```text
Task type: tiny | small | medium | large
Task: <task description>
```

Claude must load the matching template:

- tiny -> `.codex/prompts/task-small.md`
- small -> `.codex/prompts/task-small.md`
- medium -> `.codex/prompts/task-medium.md`
- large -> `.codex/prompts/task-large.md`

## Claude rules

1. Do not silently skip mandatory orchestrator artifacts required by `AGENTS.md`.
2. Do not invent command results, test results, Neo4j sync, vector sync, or deployment status.
3. If credentials are missing, generate local artifacts and mark sync pending.
4. If vector DB is missing, follow the ChromaDB fallback behavior defined in `AGENTS.md`.
5. Preserve existing files and behavior unless explicitly asked to change them.
6. Follow `ROOT_WORKSPACE_GENERATION_POLICY.md` for generated artifacts.
7. Use concise reports for tiny/small tasks.
8. Use structured plans for medium/large tasks.
